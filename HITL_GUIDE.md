## How the Feedback Loop Works Now

I've restored your proper feedback loop! Here's how it works:

### **The Process**

1. **RAG runs** → generates analysis
2. **HITL node** → calls `interrupt()` and pauses execution
3. **You see the analysis** → displayed in the interrupt message
4. **You provide input** → through the LangGraph interface
5. **Graph continues** → based on your decision

### **How to Provide Input**

When the graph pauses at a HITL node, you'll see the analysis content. To provide your decision:

**Option 1: Use the LangGraph Interface**
- Look for input fields or buttons in the interface
- Enter `true` or `false` for your decision
- The interface should handle the `Command(resume=...)` automatically

**Option 2: Manual Command (if needed)**
If the interface doesn't work, you can manually resume with:
```python
# To approve policy analysis
Command(resume=True)

# To reject and rerun policy analysis  
Command(resume=False)

# The boolean value directly represents your accept/reject decision
```

### **What Happens After Your Decision**

- **If you provide `True`**: The analysis is accepted and the workflow continues
- **If you provide `False`**: The corresponding RAG will rerun and you'll be prompted again

### **The Feedback Loop**

```
RAG_Node → HITL_Node → interrupt() → [Your Decision] → Continue or Rerun
```

This creates the proper feedback loop you wanted:
- ✅ Each RAG prompts for your approval
- ✅ You can reject and trigger reruns
- ✅ You can approve and continue
- ✅ The synthesizer only runs after all RAGs are approved
- ✅ No infinite loops or getting stuck

### **Key Benefits**

- **Full Control**: You decide whether to accept or reject each analysis
- **Proper Reruns**: Rejected analyses trigger reruns with new prompts
- **No Stuck States**: The graph responds to your input properly
- **Clean Interface**: Uses LangGraph's intended HITL pattern

The feedback loop is now restored and should work smoothly!
