Following the monetary policy normalization cycle of 2023-2024, the Federal Reserve has maintained a neutral stance in 2025, with the federal funds rate holding steady at 3.75-4.00% since Q1. Inflation has moderated to 2.8% year-over-year, approaching the Fed's 2% target, while unemployment remains low at 4.1%.\n\nKey economic indicators suggest continued expansion through 2025-2026, albeit at a more moderate pace than the post-pandemic recovery period. Consumer spending remains resilient, business investment is growing modestly, and the housing market has stabilized following the adjustment to higher mortgage rates. However, persistent challenges include labor market tightness, ongoing supply chain reconfiguration, and geopolitical uncertainties affecting trade and investment."
