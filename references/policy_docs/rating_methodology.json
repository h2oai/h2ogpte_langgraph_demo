Component scores are weighted according to the framework\n4. Final rating is determined by the weighted average\n\n### 8.2 Rating Modifiers\nThe following may adjust the calculated rating by +/- 1 notch:\n- Significant recent events not reflected in financials\n- Parent/subsidiary support considerations\n- Rapid growth or contraction\n- Material litigation or regulatory issues\n- Concentration risks (customer, supplier, geographic)\n\n### 8.3 Rating Review and Approval\n- Ratings 1-6: Credit Officer approval\n- Ratings 7: Credit Committee approval\n- Ratings 8-10: Senior Credit Committee approval\n- All ratings: Annual review required\n- Ratings 7+: Quarterly review required\n\n## 9. Migration Analysis and Validation\n- Annual back-testing of rating accuracy\n- Migration analysis by industry and size\n- Correlation testing with external ratings\n- Probability of Default calibration every 2 years\n- Independent model validation every 3 years\n    "
