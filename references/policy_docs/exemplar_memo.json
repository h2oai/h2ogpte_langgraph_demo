(\"Precision\") was founded in 2005 and specializes in high-tolerance machined components for aerospace, defense, and medical device industries. The company operates from a 45,000 sq. ft. facility in Portland, Oregon, employing 78 full-time staff. Precision has established a reputation for quality and reliability, holding ISO 9001:2015 and AS9100D certifications.\n\n### Ownership and Management\n- John Smith (CEO, 51% owner): 25+ years industry experience, founded company\n- Sarah Johnson (COO, 10% beneficial owner through Advanced Holdings): 18 years with company\n- Michael Wong (CFO): 15 years manufacturing finance experience, 7 years with company\n- Advanced Holdings, LLC (49% owner): Family investment vehicle for Johnson family\n\nManagement succession planning is in place, with Sarah Johnson identified as successor to CEO position. Key management personnel have non-compete agreements and are incentivized through profit-sharing program.\n\n### Products and Services\nPrecision offers three primary service lines:\n1. Precision CNC Machining (65% of revenue): Complex components requiring tight tolerances\n2. Assembly Services (20% of revenue): Integration of machined parts into subassemblies\n3. Design Engineering (15% of revenue): Collaborative design optimization for manufacturability\n\nThe company has strategically focused on high-margin, complex components that require specialized equipment and expertise, creating barriers to entry and reducing commoditization risk.\n\n### Market Position and Competition\nPrecision operates in the fragmented precision machining market, estimated at $25 billion annually in the US. The company holds approximately 0.2% market share nationally but has a stronger regional position (est. 2.5% in Pacific Northwest).\n\nKey competitors include:\n- Northwest Precision (larger, publicly-traded)\n- Advanced Machining Solutions (similar size, privately-held)\n- Pacific Aerospace Components (smaller, specialized in aerospace only)\n\nCompetitive advantages include:\n- Advanced 5-axis CNC equipment enabling complex geometries\n- Engineering staff with specialized industry knowledge\n- Quality certifications required for aerospace and medical applications\n- Long-standing customer relationships (avg. tenure: 6.5 years)\n\n### Customer Base\nPrecision serves 42 active customers with healthy diversification:\n- Top 5 customers represent 38% of revenue (no single customer >15%)\n- Industry diversification: Aerospace (45%), Medical (30%), Defense (15%), Industrial (10%)\n- Geographic concentration: West Coast (70%), Midwest (20%), East Coast (10%)\n- Average customer relationship: 6.5 years\n\nCustomer contracts typically span 1-3 years with specified minimum volumes. The company has maintained a 92% customer retention rate over the past five years.\n\n### Supplier Relationships\nThe company sources from 28 suppliers, primarily for:\n- Raw materials (aluminum, titanium, specialty alloys)\n- Tooling and equipment\n- Outsourced specialized processes (heat treatment, plating)\n\nNo supplier represents more than 20% of purchases, and alternative sources have been identified for all critical inputs. The company maintains 45-60 day payment terms with most suppliers.\n\n## FINANCIAL ANALYSIS\n\n### Income Statement Trends\n| Metric ($000s) | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 (Proj.) |\n|----------------|------|------|------|--------------|\n| Revenue | $12,450 | $13,825 | $15,240 | $16,750 |\n| Gross Profit | $4,605 | $5,254 | $5,944 | $6,700 |\n| Gross Margin | 37.0% | 38.0% | 39.0% | 40.0% |\n| EBITDA | $1,743 | $2,074 | $2,438 | $2,848 |\n| EBITDA Margin | 14.0% | 15.0% | 16.0% | 17.0% |\n| Net Income | $872 | $1,106 | $1,372 | $1,675 |\n| Net Margin | 7.0% | 8.0% | 9.0% | 10.0% |\n\nRevenue has grown at a 10.5% CAGR over the past three years, driven by:\n- Expanded capacity from equipment investments\n- New customer acquisition in medical device sector\n- Increased wallet share with existing aerospace customers\n\nMargins have improved consistently due to:\n- Automation investments reducing labor costs\n- Focus on higher-margin complex components\n- Improved operational efficiency from lean manufacturing initiatives\n\nProjections appear reasonable based on:\n- Existing order backlog covering 65% of projected 2025 revenue\n- Signed contracts with three new customers starting in Q1 2025\n- Planned price increases averaging 3.5% effective January 2025\n- Industry forecasts projecting 7% growth in aerospace and medical manufacturing\n\n### Balance Sheet Analysis\n| Metric ($000s) | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | Current |\n|----------------|------|------|------|---------|\n| Cash | $1,120 | $1,383 | $1,524 | $1,750 |\n| Accounts Receivable | $2,075 | $2,304 | $2,540 | $2,620 |\n| Inventory | $1,556 | $1,728 | $1,905 | $1,950 |\n| Fixed Assets (Net) | $4,980 | $5,530 | $6,096 | $6,700 |\n| Total Assets | $9,731 | $10,945 | $12,065 | $13,020 |\n| Accounts Payable | $1,037 | $1,152 | $1,270 | $1,340 |\n| Current Debt | $750 | $833 | $917 | $1,000 |\n| Long-term Debt | $3,000 | $3,333 | $3,667 | $4,000 |\n| Total Liabilities | $4,787 | $5,318 | $5,854 | $6,340 |\n| Tangible Net Worth | $4,944 | $5,627 | $6,211 | $6,680 |\n| TNW / Assets | 50.8% | 51.4% | 51.5% | 51.3% |\n\nBalance sheet remains strong with:\n- Healthy liquidity (current ratio: 1.8x)\n- Moderate leverage (debt/TNW: 0.75x)\n- Strong tangible net worth growth from retained earnings\n- Efficient working capital management (A/R days: 42, Inventory days: 65)\n\nCapital expenditures have been consistent at approximately 5% of revenue annually, focused on equipment upgrades to improve efficiency and expand capabilities.\n\n### Cash Flow and Debt Service\n| Metric ($000s) | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 (Proj.) |\n|----------------|------|------|------|--------------|\n| EBITDA | $1,743 | $2,074 | $2,438 | $2,848 |\n| Less: Capital Expenditures | $(623) | $(691) | $(762) | $(838) |\n| Less: Dividends/Distributions | $(350) | $(400) | $(450) | $(500) |\n| Less: Cash Taxes | $(218) | $(277) | $(343) | $(419) |\n| Operating Cash Flow | $552 | $706 | $883 | $1,091 |\n| Debt Service (P+I) | $1,050 | $1,133 | $1,217 | $1,350 |\n| Debt Service Coverage | 1.66x | 1.83x | 2.00x | 2.11x |\n| Fixed Charge Coverage | 1.42x | 1.56x | 1.71x | 1.80x |\n\nCash flow has strengthened consistently, with DSCR improving from 1.66x to 2.00x over the past three years.
